# NomadInterop

NomadInterop is a **powerful and easy-to-use** wrapper for the [Nomad optimizer](https://www.gerad.ca/NOMAD/), designed to **streamline** the integration of Nomad's core functions into your C++ and C# projects. Unlike the original Nomad library, which primarily supports C++, NomadInterop allows developers to utilize the optimizer's capabilities in **both C++ and C#**, making it a **versatile tool for multi-language projects.**

- Integrate Nomad's optimization functions seamlessly in both C++ and C# environments.
- Access Nomad's powerful optimization features with a straightforward and intuitive API.
- Efficient runtime and memory consumption.
- Fully open-source and available for modification to suit your specific needs.
